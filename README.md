# mailStack

mailStack is a way to easily deploy a fully-functional mail service, stacking up components like SMTP, IMAP, POP3, Webmail, File Sharing. Everything under your control.

We want to:
* Create a platform to deploy, configure and monitor mail components easily.
* Make a highly customizable mail service.
* Return mail control to the users.

We are not:
* Trying to make an bullet-proof mail service, but we'll try to add strong privacy-oriented and high performance features in a short time.

## WIP (Work in Progress)
This is a WIP project.

We want to make an open source mail solution using Postfix, Dovecot, Roundcube, Owncloud and other tools, to provide the main components of the mail stack core ( local or remotely) with a friendly web management interface.
